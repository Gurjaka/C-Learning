## 🎯 Introduction

C is a powerful and widely-used programming language, known for its efficiency and close-to-hardware capabilities. This repository is my personal sandbox to:

- Understand C syntax and concepts.
- Practice problem-solving using C.
- Experiment with different coding techniques and tools.

---

## 🤔 Why This Repository

This repository is primarily for my learning and self-improvement. By sharing my progress publicly, I hope to:

- Document my journey in a structured way.
- Receive constructive feedback from the community.
- Help others who might be starting their own journey in C.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

If you're here to follow along or try out the programs, you'll need:

- A C compiler such as GCC or Clang.
- A text editor or IDE of your choice (e.g., Vim, Visual Studio Code, etc.).

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gurjaka/C-Learning.git
cd C-Learning
```

### Compile and Run a Program

Navigate to the directory containing the program you want to run and compile it using:

> Note: most programs are already compiled, and you only have to run them, this is for case when you've added your own program

```bash
cc program_name.c -o ./compiled/program_name
./compiled/program_name
```

For example:

```bash
cc hello_world.c -o ./compiled/hello_world
./compiled/hello_world
```
